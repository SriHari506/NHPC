            <h1>History of NHPC</h1>
            <p>NHPC Limited, initially known as National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, was incorporated in the year 1975 with an objective to plan, promote, and organize an integrated and efficient development of hydroelectric power in all aspects. Since its inception, NHPC has grown to become a premier organization in the country for the development of hydropower.</p>
            <p>In the early years, NHPC was involved in the execution of several hydroelectric projects in the Himalayan regions, which posed significant challenges due to the difficult terrain and adverse weather conditions. However, with the dedicated efforts of its workforce, NHPC successfully commissioned several projects, contributing significantly to the power sector in India.</p>
            <p>In recognition of its performance, NHPC was conferred the status of a 'Mini Ratna' by the Government of India in 1998, and later, the 'Navaratna' status in 2008, further empowering the company to invest in new projects and expand its capabilities.</p>
            <p>Today, NHPC has an installed capacity of over 7071 MW from 24 power stations and continues to play a crucial role in the development of renewable energy in the country.</p>
